This repository is a C++/OpenCV implementation of the [Stereo Odometry based on careful Feature selection and Tracking](ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/7320493/7324045/07324219.pdf), as a part of the course project for [Probabilistic Mobile Robotics](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~gpandey/ee_698g.html).

The MATLAB implementation of this can be found [here](https://github.com/Mayankm96/Stereo-Odometry-SOFT).
